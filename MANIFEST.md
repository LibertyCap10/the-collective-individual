# The Collective Individual – Manifest

## Working Title
**The Collective Individual**

## Intent
This book is about how a person becomes themselves in relation to:
- Language
- Frames and games
- Primordial structures of reality
- Rational agency
- The “meta frame” and “meta game”

It is both a map and a set of tools for self-orientation.

## Tone
- Conversational but precise
- Philosophical, not vague
- Mythic without being mystical
- Respectful of the reader’s intelligence

## Reader Promise
By the end, the reader should:
- Better see the frames they’re inside of
- Understand how games shape identity
- Grasp what “rational agency” means in practice
- Have a felt sense of playing the *meta game* more intentionally

## Constraints
- Avoid unnecessary jargon; when used, define it clearly.
- Prefer concrete examples over abstract hand-waving.
- Each chapter must implicitly answer:  
  **“What does this let the reader *do* differently?”**
