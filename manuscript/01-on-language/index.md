# On Language

Language is the act labeling the world as to create a referential map, or a frame.  

To exist is to exist in a (mundane) world of particulars.  

We label particulars, and labeling is fundamentally categorical in that it is about patterns / buckets.  In-groups and out-groups. 

With labeling, therefore, we get abstractions, and this is the key to understanding Rationality and the power of Rational Agency.  

Abstractions allow for the compacting (or the compressing) of information.  Instead of having to play every iteration of a game, you can familiarize yourself with general rules/heuristics and find success more often that not and with relatively little information.  

With this same principle of Abstracting to Navigate, this philosphical framework presumes that it is possible to inform a single lifetime in such a way as to optimize that life in terms of Meaning / existential satisfaction.  Informing a single lifetime in this way is identical to handing someone the Philospher's Stone, which authenticates the beholder.  

For Rational Agents, we are forever incomplete.  Terenece Mckenna calls our situation "a determined systemed that is yet undetermined".  And in Geothe's play Floust there is a character who says "If I could become an angel I would not, I would stay a man. Because an angel is perfected, but as a man I can always improve". 

So, that is a superpower, actually, to be inexaustable yet to hold the Amulet of Exausting (the philospher's stone / The Metaphysic).  It is to be the infinitely intensifying light.  

And I think of Carl Jung, who points out shadow integration and how only the tree whose roots reach to hell can have branches that reach to heaven.  And in this same way, the bright our light becomes, the greater the darkness that is revealed, and it is up to us in our ability to engineer our environments and thereby ourselves, to engineer our way eternally towards salvation.
