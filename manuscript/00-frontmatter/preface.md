## Preface

This is a book about rational agency, and how a pluralistic Contextual Framework may lead to the development of a pluralistic individual (who is fundamentally non-parochial).  This book formulates and defends the argument that it is possible to orient (the activity of) a rational agent such that they preserve potentiality / un-limit their Will ever-more-fully (i.e., selection opens rather than closes successive possibility), thereby providing a solution to the Meaning Crisis (by describing/prescribing an authentic/authenticating identity). 

Ironically, it is not the agent who hides in spaces of security that orients optimally, but the agent who voluntarily explores and incorporates that orients optimally. It's the (asymptotic) incorporation of the world at the individual level that is the key.

Put another way, this book is about understanding each of our Reality as a reality beheld by a Rational Agent who is fundamentally **limited** (because to exist is to exist as a product of a constrained reality -- our structures are billions of years old, we emerge in a/the "Goldilock Zone", etc.).  But it is presumed here that it is possible to Orient the Limited Will (a defining faculty of Rational Agency) in such a way as to un-limit-it ever-more-fully; as to, in some sense, invert, or otherwise play on finitude in such a way as to mimic/simulate/emulate infinity.

As limited Beings, we are irrevocably enmeshed-in and bound-to the particular world.  ..Or are we? 

We seem to have this unique ability, as Rational Agents, to label our environment as to categorize (or bucketize) it.  We recognize patterns in the particulars. And that, I believe, is our superpower.  We have the ability to abstract - and not just one layer, but we can move up an 'abstraction chain'.  From Particulars, to Generals, and perhaps to Universals.  

This book is about looking at Reality this way, and about looking at our Rational Agency - each of our Limited Will - as a tool of Selection that has Ontological Reality.  Each time that we Act, we Actualize - we select One over against all other Possible, and in that way we are identical to Nature itself (the Universe writ large) in that we have this sense that we genuinely Author(ize) reality.  Put coloquially, we are each a Child of God, or made in God's image (because God/Nature Selects all that exists and we are piggybacking on this process, imitating it).  And so to Act Authentically is, in my view, this sort of hyper-activity or self-referential bootstraping dynamic where "what I do" gives something "deep within me" resonance/reverence/authenticity/authorization/extension. 

Also, as a product of Nature, I am co-terminuous with Nature.

And so it seems possible to somehow 'abstract' from the particular mundane reality this labeling/patterning/mapping which folds reality onto itself in such a way as to.. purify it? To hyper-actualize it? To reify it? The appropriate words are unclear to me in this moment.  But there is something that Kant was onto with Transcendentalism and this idea of the Kingdom of Ends.  The problem is that his languge is opaque to us, and therefore difficult to use as a scaffolding technology (which language and ideas are essentially).  But what Kant was trying to do, I think, is articulate this imagined realm which speaks to our "Common Humanity" or "Authentic Selves" or "Authentic Nature", something like that.  Which makes me think also of the Ancient Greeks who birthed Western Civilization - they were fundamentally pluralistic in their philosophical questioning and cultural development.  They asked "What is our ultimate goal? To be great Athenians? To be great Spartans?" the answer to those questions is "No".  The ultimate goal is to figure out what it means to be a great Human Being, which is synonymous with what it means to be a great Rational Agency, because it seems that Rational Agency IS (through discovery by this mehtod of inquiry) our defining characteristic.  It is what we are, essentially.  We are Rational Agents.  Everywhere that you find human beings, you find them (1) Aggregating their environment (2) reproportioning it through activity and (3) the production of technology (through that reproportioning actiity) that allows us to EXTEND through it and become ever-more CAPACTIOUS. We are fundamentally self-extending creatures.  We are limited, but we can modify our environment as to adapt and persevere.  And that isn't just what we are in a "oh nice we can be warm when it's cold and have abundance in times of scarcity" sort of way, but we seem to be able to literally chart our destiny into the stars and to the End of the Universe.  We literally have the capacity to map that out, and say "oh, well.. if the Universe began with an exapansion then it probbably ends in a contraction.  We fundamentally aggregate and extend.  Perhaps WE are the conduit through-which the universe contracts? What if we are the conduits through-which the universe reverses entropy? What if our fundamental nature is extropic? 





### Primordial Dynamic of Rational Agency

- Rational Agency presumes "ownership" of a Limited Will (the reach that pushes away)

- I am a product of my environment.  
I can perturb my environment.  
Therefore, To some degree, I am a product of my own perturbance (my own self / exercised limited will)

- Exercise the Limited Will in such a way as to un-limit it ever-more-fully 



### Axioms

This book is written for readers who suspect that:  

- Reality is fundamentally two sided (which may be because of Human nature of because of Nature nature, it is unclear). 
- Reality is That Which Selects.    
- They are That Which Selects.  
- They are a Rational Agent.   
- They are a Limited Will.   
- Persistence is Existence.  
- That which is, is what it is, in virtue of it not being everything else.    
- Which is to say that: That which exists, exists over and against all that could have existed, but that does not exist as a consequence of this existing.   
- The mind is a mirror.  
- The inside is co-terminous with the outside.  
- The personalities we interact with 'out there' stick around to some degree 'in here'.     
- The personalities out there become resonant (or discordant) with personalities in here.    
- A game is a bounded circumstance, so every moment may be characterized as a game.    
- A game is synonymous with a competence hierarchy or a domain of skill;   
- Skills can develop Synergy across Domains, so that operating within one Domain simultaneously increases competence across other Domains (esentially unlocking the fundamental Limitation of our Being, because ever-more "competence" may be packed into the same amount of time; providing a ceilingless domain for development of the Self).    
- Each Individual is capable of transmuting their mundane existence into a transendental existence, through the internal development and application of the Meta-Frame.
