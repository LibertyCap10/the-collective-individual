# Preface

This is a book about rational agency, and how, through Context > Identity > Ethic, a rational agent may Act with Intention (pre-emption) such that a divine frame is inhabited which brings about divine revelation (in respect to the situation of one's own self-emergent perspective and activity) that is ontologically real and reifying.  A divine frame is a frame which aspires towards ever-greater-approximation with the Meta Frame.  Inhabiting the Meta Frame is to bring into a given moment the Meta Game, which is the application of a transcendental standard upon the mundane world which.. purifies, hyper-selects, etc. and brings the moment into a state of ever-greater elevation.  It is impossible to truly inhabit the Meta-Frame and play the Meta-Game, but it is a standard that may be approximated infinitely close (like a limit in calculus).  

- Rational Agency presumes "ownership" of a Limited Will (the reach that pushes away)

- I am a product of my environment.  
I can perturb my environment.  
Therefore, To some degree, I am a product of my own perturbance (my own self / exercised limited will)

- Exercise the Limited Will in such a way as to un-limit it ever-more-fully


This book is written for readers who suspect that:
- Reality is fundamentally two sided (which may be because of Human nature of because of Nature nature, it is unclear)
- Reality is That Which Selects.  
- They are That Which Selects.
- They are a Rational Agent. 
- They are a Limited Will.  
- That which is, is what it is, in virtue of it not being everything else.  
- Which is to say that: That which exists, exists over and against all that could have existed, but that does not exist as a consequence of this existing.
- The mind is a mirror.
- The inside is co-terminous with the outside.
- The personalities we interact with 'out there' stick around to some degree 'in here'.   
- The personalities out there become resonant (or discordant) with personalities in here.  
- A game is a bounded circumstance, so every moment may be characterized as a game.  
- A game is synonymous with a competence hierarchy or a domain of skill;
- Skills can develop Synergy across Domains, so that operating within one Domain simultaneously increases competence across other Domains (esentially unlocking the fundamental Limitation of our Being, because ever-more "competence" may be packed into the same amount of time; providing a ceilingless domain for development of the Self).  
- Each Individual is capable of transmuting their mundane existence into a transendental existence, through the internal development and application of the Meta-Frame.
