## Preface

This is a book about rational agency, and how a pluralistic Contextual Framework may lead to the development of a pluralistic individual (who is fundamentally non-parochial).  This book formulates and defends the argument that it is possible to orient (the activity of) a rational agent such that they preserve potentiality / un-limit their Will ever-more-fully (i.e., selection opens rather than closes successive possibility).  Ironically, it is not the agent who hides in spaces of security that orients optimally, but the agent who voluntarily explores and incorporates that orients optimally.  


A divine frame is a frame which aspires towards ever-greater-approximation with the Meta Frame.  Inhabiting the Meta Frame is to bring into a given moment the Meta Game, which is the application of a transcendental standard upon the mundane world which.. purifies, hyper-selects, etc. and brings the moment into a state of ever-greater elevation.  It is impossible to truly inhabit the Meta-Frame and play the Meta-Game, but it is a standard that may be approximated infinitely close (like a limit in calculus).  

- Rational Agency presumes "ownership" of a Limited Will (the reach that pushes away)

- I am a product of my environment.  
I can perturb my environment.  
Therefore, To some degree, I am a product of my own perturbance (my own self / exercised limited will)

- Exercise the Limited Will in such a way as to un-limit it ever-more-fully 



### Axioms

This book is written for readers who suspect that:  
- Reality is fundamentally two sided (which may be because of Human nature of because of Nature nature, it is unclear). 
- Reality is That Which Selects.    
- They are That Which Selects.  
- They are a Rational Agent.   
- They are a Limited Will.   
- Persistence is Existence.  
- That which is, is what it is, in virtue of it not being everything else.    
- Which is to say that: That which exists, exists over and against all that could have existed, but that does not exist as a consequence of this existing.   
- The mind is a mirror.  
- The inside is co-terminous with the outside.  
- The personalities we interact with 'out there' stick around to some degree 'in here'.     
- The personalities out there become resonant (or discordant) with personalities in here.    
- A game is a bounded circumstance, so every moment may be characterized as a game.    
- A game is synonymous with a competence hierarchy or a domain of skill;   
- Skills can develop Synergy across Domains, so that operating within one Domain simultaneously increases competence across other Domains (esentially unlocking the fundamental Limitation of our Being, because ever-more "competence" may be packed into the same amount of time; providing a ceilingless domain for development of the Self).    
- Each Individual is capable of transmuting their mundane existence into a transendental existence, through the internal development and application of the Meta-Frame.
