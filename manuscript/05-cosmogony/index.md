# Cosmogony


> *"Persistence is existence"*

While considering how to parse reality as to tell a Cosmogony - a story of cosmic creation - the first thing that comes to mind is that it's difficult to know where to start. We could do a scientific investigation into the origins of the cosmos and tell the story that way.  We could also sit in an armchair and introspect categorically into the origins of what it must take to have anythin in the first instance.  

Taking the latter course, the first thing that comes to mind is that there must be some storehouse that can be mined from over time.  There is no way of getting around it, and it seems we may never know if this is a prodcut of our two-sidedness or of the two-sidedness of Nature itself.  But nonethess, he need a storehouse and a mining of it over time.  

And so we start with Infinite Potentiality as our storehouse.  
This is pandoras box (Pan Dora means "All the Gifts" by the way).  

And then there must be some initial moment at which the process begins.  Some Initial Actuality.  

What is interesting to consider is whether or not this Initial Actuality was by necessity or if it could have been other than it was.  If it could have been other than it was, then there must have been some 'Potential Initial Actualities' that could have been but all consequentially are not.  

Regardless of the necessity of this Initial Actuality, it does bring to mind Determinism, and at what point along the process (if any) there becomes to be 'Potential Actualities that Could have been but Consequentially are not'.  

The most satisfying frame to me is that the Initial Actuality as not itself by necessity, it could have been alternative ways but is the particular way it was.  And every moment thereafter has been the same way.

But it could be that Potentiality itself is an illusion.  Perhaps there is only Actuality.  This is full determinism.  

What I don't like about this framing (that Potentiality is an Illusion) is that it seems to necessitate that what exists is in some sense Perfect.  Because we clearly can comprehend alternatives that "could have been but consequentially are not and therefore never can be", and so we in our cosmically limited nature can comprehend this domain of Potentiality.  Its seems wrong that THIS is what would be selected as divine, unveering perfection.  That THIS, with babies dying and animals suffering by the billions, that this would be the Only Actuality that would exists and that it could never be different.  That is hell.  

Far more desirable to me is the framing that Nature is a process that is aiming towards an End, and that we are conduits that assist in selecting (hyper-selecting) towards this end.  This is FAR more exciting and interesting of a reality to live within - to be co-operating with Nature itself (wrestling with God) as to bring about a Just and Flourishing reality.  

So it isn't that there was a rational agent at the beginning of time that brought reality into existence.  It's that reality has self-so exploded into existence and we are the Gods that are in charge of captaining this ship.  

It is up to us to seperate the wheat from the chaffe.
