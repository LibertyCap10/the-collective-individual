# Frames and Games

> *“Reality is presumed to be fundamentally continuous. It is one, continuous unity and all parts are interrelated (holographic).  But obviously there are punctuations in this continuity.  So we can say that reality is both Continuous (primarily) and Discrete (secondarily).  It is a continuous unity but it admits of punctuations/bounds.”*  



A frame is a projection of bounds onto an otherwise continuous reality.  
A game is a bounded circumstance inhabited by 1 or more rational agents.

In this chapter, we explore:
- How frames select what matters
- How games reward some moves and punish others
- How identity congeals around the games we repeatedly win or lose
- How it is possible to bring self-awareness to this process and develop a Meta-Frame, which is a Frame that acknowledges/judges/criticizes/generates successive frames
