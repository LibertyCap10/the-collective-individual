# Primordial Frames

Before there are social roles or institutions, there are primordial frames:
- Self vs. world
- Agent vs. environment
- Threat vs. opportunity

These are pre-reflective ways of carving reality that every creature must navigate.

So you can say that there are frames that are built into us at a deep structural level - millions of years of evolution has baked these perception-response patterns into us and these structures govern how we see the world.  Your eyes are always moving back and forth at an incredible rate, and what they are litteraly doing is seperating foreground from background.  The eyes are parsing relevance from irrelevance.

> — **Plato**

So we are baked into a bottom-up circumstance to some substantial degree.  But this is not our fate.  

It seems possible to apply top-down recognition to the entirety of our Being, and like Siddhartha Goutama, choose to go sit under a tree until we 'figure it out'.  It may be weak at times, but we have a Limited Will which we may poke and prod ourselves with.  And over time, it is possible to Select ourselves into a path that is ever-more governed by our own pre-empting stadards of Selection.  

Here are some primordial frames: 

- Foreground vs Background
- Potentiality vs Actuality
- Inside vs Outside
- Individual vs Collective
- Continuous vs Discrete
- Self vs Other

- Masculine vs Feminine 
- Order vs Chaos
- Top vs Bottom
- Outside vs Inside
