# The Meta Frame and The Meta Game

The **Meta Frame** is the frame that is critical-of and thereby generative-of successive frames.  
The **Meta Game** is the game played by agents who behold the Meta Frame.  

Here we begin to:
- Step outside particular games
- Compare them
- Identify synergy across games
- Think about playing games in such a way as to be invited to play again
- Ask: *Which games are worthy of me?* and *Which games help me become who I aim to be?*
