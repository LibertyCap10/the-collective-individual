# The Meta Frame and The Meta Game

The **meta frame** is the frame about frames.  
The **meta game** is the game of choosing which games to play.

Here we begin to:
- Step outside particular games
- Compare them
- Ask: *Which games are worthy of me?* and *Which games help me become who I aim to be?*
